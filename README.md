# üåü‚ù§Ô∏è yuusei - the calculator is alive!
yuusei is a conversational engine that goes against the grain. Because everyone else is building out these CoT, LangChain, messy agents. They want to make the AI edit their videos, organize their files... **I want the AI to make you feel better after a long day.**  
This is essentially a complete rewrite of NemoiaEngine, which was closed-source and just, horrible unmaintainable code. I thought, if I'm writing decent code, why not share it?

## Features
[ ] **Basic chat**
    Essentially just the actual "talk to it and it talks back." functionality.

[ ] Identities

## How to contribute
Don't. At least, not for now. Unless you're full-blast TPOT posthumanist gaming and understand what a "qualia" and a "p-zombie" are.

## How to run?
Not working yet. But, assuming you have a conda distro...
```
git clone https://github.com/AuroraNemoia/yuusei
cd yuusei
conda create -n yuusei python=3.10
conda activate yuusei
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
